# Polymorphism

Polymorphism in C++ allows functions and operators to behave differently based on the input. It can be categorized into:
- Compile-time Polymorphism (Function Overloading, Operator Overloading)
- Run-time Polymorphism (Virtual Functions)

This section demonstrates various examples of polymorphism in C++.
