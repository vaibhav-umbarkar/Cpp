# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. This concept is a fundamental part of object-oriented programming (OOP).

In this example, we'll demonstrate encapsulation using a class in C++.
